# Welcome to my page, I'm SwissNuff (Arian) 👋
I started young selling to classmates, hustling on the side, and doing random side quests for adults. I sold junkyard scraps, bought a photocopy machine, and called it passive income.

In high school, I learned design and UI/UX for quick cash. I chased being a jack of all trades and took up computer science @[UP Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) because software paid well and was _“hard to automate.”_ <sub>(Yikes.. did not age well)</sub>

Now I’m mashing all my skills together to find my ikigai, help the community, and make it rain.
